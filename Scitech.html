<h3>If you're looking for a crash course in all things science, look no further. Basic Science includes a little bit of information about a lot of scientific topics. <p><p><i>Have you ever wondered why animals have changed over millions of years? Are you curious about the mystery of how cells are decoded to create every unique living creature including you?</i></p> </p>Everything from Research and Study Basics to Kingdoms are explored and discovered in Basic Science.</h3>

             </div>
           <div class="well">
           	<h3>In the field of geology, you will often hear a variety of terms including the word "mineral." What are minerals, exactly? They are any substance that meets these four specific qualities:</h3>
           	<div class="alert alert-success">
           		
           			<ol>

    <li>Minerals are natural: These substances that form without any human help.</li>
    <li>Minerals are solid: They don't droop or melt or evaporate.</li>
    <li>Minerals are inorganic: They aren't carbon compounds like those found in living things.</li>

    <li>Minerals are crystalline: They have a distinct recipe and arrangement of atoms.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h2>Unnatural Minerals</h2>

<p>Until the 1990s, mineralogists could propose names for chemical compounds that formed during the breakdown of artificial substances...things found in places like industrial sludge pits and rusting cars. That loophole is now closed, but there are minerals on the books that aren't truly natural.</p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<h2>Soft Minerals</h2>

<p>Traditionally and officially, native mercury is considered a mineral, even though the metal is liquid at room temperature. At about -40 C, though, it solidifies and forms crystals like other metals. So there are parts of Antarctica where mercury is unimpeachably a mineral.</p>

<p>For a less extreme example, consider the mineral ikaite, a hydrated calcium carbonate that forms only in cold water.</p>

<p>It degrades into calcite and water above 8 C. It is significant in the polar regions, the ocean floor, and other cold places, but you can't bring it into the lab except in a freezer.</p>

<p>Ice is a mineral, even though it isn't listed in the mineral field guide. When ice collects in large enough bodies, it flows in its solid state -- that's what glaciers are.</p>

<p>And salt (halite) behaves similarly, rising underground in broad domes and sometimes spilling out in salt glaciers. Indeed, all minerals, and the rocks they are part of, slowly deform given enough heat and pressure. That's what makes plate tectonics possible. So in a sense, no minerals are really solid except maybe diamonds.</p>

<p>Other minerals that aren't quite solid are instead flexible. The mica minerals are the best-known example, but molybdenite is another. Its metallic flakes can be crumpled like aluminum foil. The asbestos mineral chrysotile is stringy enough to weave into cloth.</p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">

<h2>Organic Minerals</h2>

<p>The rule that minerals must be inorganic may be the strictest one. The substances that make up coal, for instance, are different kinds of hydrocarbon compounds derived from cell walls, wood, pollen, and so on. These are called macerals instead of minerals (for more, see Coal in a Nutshell). </p>
	<p>If coal is squeezed hard enough for long enough, the carbon sheds all its other elements and becomes graphite. Even though it is of organic origin, graphite is a true mineral with carbon atoms arranged in sheets. Diamonds, similarly, are carbon atoms arranged in a rigid framework. After some four billion years of life on Earth, it's safe to say that all the world's diamonds and graphite are of organic origin even if they aren't strictly speaking organic.</p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success">

<h2>Amorphous Minerals</h2>

<p>A few things fall short in crystallinity, hard as we try. Many minerals form crystals that are too small to see under the microscope. But even these can be shown to be crystalline at the nanoscale using the technique of X-ray powder diffraction, though, because X-rays are a super-shortwave type of light that can image extremely small things.</p>

<p>Having a crystal form means that the substance has a chemical formula. It might be as simple as halite's (NaCl) or complex like epidote's (Ca2Al2(Fe3+, Al)(SiO4)(Si2O7)O(OH)), but if you were shrunk to an atom's size, you could tell what mineral you were seeing by its molecular makeup and arrangement.</p>

<p>A few substances fail the X-ray test. They are truly glasses or colloids, with a fully random structure at the atomic scale. They are amorphous, scientific Latin for "formless." These get the honorary name mineraloid.</p>

           	<h1>What is a Rock? These Four Things Will Tell You </h1>
           </center>

           <p><h3>What is a rock, exactly? </p><p><i>After some thought and discussion, most people will agree that rocks are more or less hard solids, of natural origin and made of minerals. But to geologists, all of those criteria have exceptions.</i></h3></p>
           <div class="alert alert-success">
<h2>What is a Rock? Is It Hard?</h2>

<p>Not necessarily. Some common rocks can be scratched with your fingernails such as shale, soapstone, gypsum rock, and peat. Others may be soft in the ground, but they harden once they spend time in the air (and vice versa).</p>

<p>And there is an imperceptible gradation between consolidated rocks and unconsolidated sediments. Indeed, geologists name and map many formations that don't consist of rock at all. This is why geologists refer to work with igneous and metamorphic rocks as "hard-rock geology," opposed to "sedimentary petrology."</p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h2>What is a Rock? Is It Solid?</h2>

<p>Some rocks are far from completely solid. Many rocks include water in their pore spaces. Many geodes -- hollow objects found in limestone country -- hold water inside them like coconuts. Two rocks that are barely solids include fine lava threads known as Pele's hair and the fine open meshwork of exploded lava reticulite.</p>

<p>Then there's the matter of temperature. Mercury is a liquid metal at room temperature (and down to -40 F), and petroleum is a fluid unless it's asphalt erupted into cold ocean water. And good old ice meets all the criteria of rock-hood too...in permafrost and in glaciers.</p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<h2>What is a Rock? Are They Natural?</h2>

<p>Not entirely. The longer humans stay on this planet, the more that concrete accumulates. Concrete is a mixture of sand and pebbles (aggregate) and a mineral glue (cement) of calcium silicate compounds. It is a synthetic conglomerate and it acts just like the natural rock, turning up in riverbeds and on beaches.</p>

<p>Some of it has entered the rock cycle to be discovered by future geologists.</p>

<p>Brick, too, is an artificial rock -- in this case, an artificial form of massive slate. (See the Artificial Rocks Gallery for more examples.)</p>

<p>Another human product that closely resembles rock is slag, the byproduct of metal smelting. Slag is a complex mixture of oxides that has many uses including road-building and concrete aggregate. It has found its way into sedimentary rocks already.</p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h2>What is a Rock? Is It Made of Minerals?</h2>

<p>Many are not. Minerals are inorganic compounds with chemical formulas and mineral names such as quartz or pyrite (see "What Is a Mineral?"). Coal is made of organic material, not minerals. The various types of stuff in coal are instead called macerals. Similarly, what about coquina...a rock made entirely of seashells? Shells are made of mineral matter, but they aren't minerals any more than teeth are.</p>

<p>Finally, we have the exception of obsidian. Obsidian is a rock glass, in which little or none of its material has gathered into crystals. It is an undifferentiated mass of geological material, rather like slag but not as colorful. While obsidian has no minerals in it per se, it is unquestionably a rock.</p>

               	    <p><h4>Abrasives today are largely precision-manufactured substances, but natural mineral abrasives are often still used. A good abrasive mineral is not just hard, but also tough and sharp. It must be plentiful -- or at least widespread -- and pure.</h4></p>

                     <p><h4>Not many minerals share all these attributes, so the list of abrasive minerals is short but interesting.</h4></p> 
                 </div>
                     <div class="alert alert-info">
                     <h2>Sanding Abrasives</h2> 

<p>Sanding was originally done with (surprise!) sand -- fine-grained quartz.</p>

<p>Quartz sand is hard enough for woodworking (Mohs hardness 7), but it's not very tough or sharp. The virtue of sand sandpaper is its cheapness, but I've never seen any and I doubt that it's made anymore. Fine woodworkers do occasionally use flint sandpaper or glass paper. Flint, a form of chert, is a rock made of microcrystalline quartz. It's no harder than quartz but it's tougher so its sharp edges last longer. Garnet paper is still widely available. The garnet mineral almandine is harder than quartz (Mohs 7.5), but its real virtue is its sharpness, giving it cutting power without scratching wood too deeply.</p>

<p>Corundum is the workhorse abrasive of sandpaper. Extremely hard (Mohs 9) and sharp, corundum is also usefully brittle, breaking into sharp fragments that keep on cutting. It's great for wood, metal, paint and plastic. All sanding products today use artificial corundum -- aluminum oxide.</p>

<p>If you find an old stash of emery cloth or paper, it probably uses the real mineral. Emery is a natural mix of fine-grained corundum and magnetite.</p>

<p>Visit Woodworking Guide Chris Baylor to learn more about choosing sandpaper. He includes various artificial grits that have never been minerals.</p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success">

<h2>Polishing Abrasives</h2> 

<p>Three natural abrasives are commonly used for polishing and cleaning metal: enamel finishes, plastic and tile.</p>

<p>Pumice is a stone, not a mineral, a volcanic product with a very fine grain. Its hardest mineral is quartz, so it has a gentler action than sanding abrasives. Softer still is feldspar (Mohs 6), which is most famously used in the Bon Ami brand household cleaner. For the most delicate polishing and cleaning work, such as with jewelry and fine crafts, the gold standard is tripoli, also called rottenstone. Tripoli is microscopic, microcrystalline quartz mined from beds of decomposed limestone.
</p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h2>Sandblasting and Waterjet Cutting</h2>

<p>Applications of these industrial processes range from scrubbing rust off of steel girders to inscribing gravestones, and a wide range of blasting abrasives is in use today. Sand is one, of course, but airborne dust from crystalline silica is a health hazard. Safer alternatives include garnet, olivine (Mohs 6.5) and staurolite (Mohs 7.5). Which to choose depends on many factors other than mineralogical considerations, including cost, availability, the material being worked, and the experience of the worker. Many artificial abrasives are in use in these applications, too, as well as in exotic things like ground walnut shells and solid carbon dioxide.</p>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-success">
	<h2>Diamond Grit</h2>

The hardest mineral of all is diamond (Mohs 10), and diamond abrasive is a large part of the world diamond market.

Diamond paste is available in many grades for sharpening hand tools, and you can even buy nail files impregnated with diamond grit for the ultimate grooming aid. Diamond is best suited for cutting and grinding tools, however, and the drilling industry uses lots of diamond for drill bits. The material used is worthless as jewelry, being black or included - full of inclusions - or too fine-grained. This grade of diamond is called bort.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success">

<h2>Diatomaceous Earth</h2>

The powdery substance composed of the microscopic shells of diatoms is known as diatomaceous earth or DE. Diatoms are a kind of algae that form exquisite skeletons of amorphous silica. DE is not abrasive to humans, metals or anything else in our everyday world, but at the microscopic scale, it's very damaging to insects. The broken edges of crushed diatom shells scratch holes in their hard outer skins, causing their internal fluids to dry out.

It's safe enough to strew in the garden or to mix with food, such as stored grain, to prevent infestations. When they aren't calling it diatomite, geologists have another name for DE, borrowed from German: kieselguhr.

               	<h1>The Science Behind the 2010 Haiti Earthquake </h1>
               </center>
               <div class="jumbotron">
               	<p>On January 12th, 2010, a country long devastated by corrupt leadership and extreme poverty was dealt another blow. A magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti, killing approximately 250,000 people and displacing another 1.5 million. In terms of magnitude, this earthquake wasn't very remarkable; in fact, there were 17 larger earthquakes in 2010 alone. Haiti's lack of economic resources and reliable infrastructure, however, made this one of the deadliest earthquakes of all time.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="alert alert-info">
               <h2>Geologic Setting</h2>

<p>Haiti makes up the western portion of Hispaniola, an island in the Greater Antilles of the Caribbean Sea. The island sits on the Gonâve microplate, the largest of four microplates that lay between the North American and Caribbean plates. Although the area isn't as prone to earthquakes as the Pacific Ring of Fire, geologists were aware that this area posed a risk (see this article from 2005). </p>

<p>Scientist initially pointed to the well-known Enriquillo–Plantain Garden fault zone (EPGFZ), a system of strike-slip faults that make up the Gonâve microplate - Caribbean plate boundary and were overdue for an earthquake. As months passed, however, they realized the answer was not so simple. Some energy was displaced by the EPGFZ, but most of it came from the previously unmapped Léogâne fault. Unfortunately, this means that the EPGFZ still has a sizable amount of energy waiting to be released.</p>

 </div>
 <div class="alert alert-success">
<h2>Tsunami</h2>

<p>Although tsunamis are often associated with earthquakes, Haiti's geologic setting made it an unlikely candidate for a massive wave.  Strike-slip faults, like those associated with this quake, move plates side-to-side and don't normally trigger tsunamis. Normal and reverse fault movements, which actively shift the seafloor up and down, are usually the culprits.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the small magnitude of this event and its occurrence on land, not off the coast, made a tsunami even more unlikely. </p>

<p>Haiti's coast, however, has a large buildup of coastal sedimentation - the country's extreme dry and wet seasons cause vast amounts of sediment to travel from the mountains to the ocean. To make matters worse, there had not been a recent earthquake to release this buildup of potential energy. The 2010 earthquake did just that, causing an underwater landslide that triggered a localized tsunami. </p>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">
<h2>Aftermath</h2> 

<p>Less than six weeks after the devastation in Haiti, a magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck Chile. This quake was approximately 500 times stronger, yet its death toll (500) was only five percent of Haiti's. How could this be? </p>

<p>For starters, the Haiti earthquake's epicenter was located only nine miles from Port-au-Prince, the country's capital and largest city, and the focus occurred a shallow six miles underground. These factors alone could be potentially catastrophic anywhere around the world. </p>

<p>To compound matters, Haiti is vastly impoverished and lacks proper building codes and sturdy infrastructure. Residents of Port-au-Prince used whatever construction material and space was available, and many lived in simple concrete structures (it is estimated that 86 percent of the city lived in slum conditions) that were immediately demolished.</p>

<p>Cities at the epicenter experienced X Mercalli intensity.</p> 

<p>Hospitals, transportation facilities and communication systems were rendered useless. Radio stations went off the air and nearly 4,000 convicts escaped from a Port-au-Prince prison. Over 52 magnitude 4.5 or greater aftershocks crippled an already devastated country in the following days. </p>

<p>Unheard of amounts of aid poured in from nations around the world. Over 13.4 billion dollars were pledged to relief and recovery efforts, with United States contributions making up nearly 30 percent. The damaged roads, airport and seaports, however, made relief efforts extremely difficult. </p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<h2>Looking Back </h2>

<p>Recovery has been slow, but the country is gradually returning to normal; unfortunately, "normalcy" in Haiti oftentimes means political turmoil and mass poverty.</p>

<p>Haiti still has the highest infant mortality rate and lowest life expectancy of any country in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p>Yet, there are small signs of hope. The economy has improved, helped by debt forgiveness from institutions around the world. The tourism industry, which was beginning to show signs of promise before the earthquake, is slowly returning. The CDC has helped make vast improvements to Haiti's public health systems. Still, another earthquake to the area anytime soon would result in terrible consequences. </p>

<p>Of course, the issues that affect Haiti are very complex and extend beyond the scope of this article. Check out some of the suggested readings to gain a better understanding of the country's difficult situation and ways that you can help. </p>

               		What Is Subduction?
               	</center>
               	<div class="jumbotron">
               		<h4>Subduction, Latin for "carried under," is a term used for a specific type of plate interaction. It happens when one lithospheric plate meets another—that is, in convergent zones—and the denser plate sinks down into the mantle.</h4>
               	</div>
               	<div class="alert alert-success">

               	<h2>How Subduction Happens</h2>

<p>Continents are made up of rocks that are too buoyant to be carried much farther than about 100 kilometers deep. So when a continent meets a continent, no subduction occurs (instead, the plates collide and thicken).</p>

<p>True subduction happens only to oceanic lithosphere.</p>

<p>When oceanic lithosphere meets continental lithosphere, the continent always stays on top while the oceanic plate subducts. When two oceanic plates meet, the older plate subducts. </p>

<p>Oceanic lithosphere is formed hot and thin at mid-ocean ridges and grows thick as more rock hardens underneath it. As it moves away from the ridge, it cools. Rocks shrink as they cool, so the plate becomes more dense and sits lower than younger, hotter plates. Therefore, when two plates meet, the younger, higher plate has an edge and does not sink.</p>

<p>Oceanic plates do not float on the asthenosphere like ice on water—they are more like sheets of paper on water, ready to sink as soon as one edge can start the process. They are gravitationally unstable.</p>

<p>Once a plate begins to subduct, gravity takes over. A descending plate is usually referred to as a "slab." Where very old seafloor is being subducted, the slab falls almost straight down, and where younger plates are being subducted, the slab descends at a shallow angle.</p>

<p>Subduction, in the form of gravitational "slab pull," is thought to be the largest force driving plate tectonics.</p>

<p>At a certain depth, the high pressure turns the basalt in the slab to a denser rock, eclogite (that is, a feldspar-pyroxene mixture becomes garnet-pyroxene). This makes the slab even more eager to descend.</p>

<p>It's a mistake to picture subduction as a sumo match, a battle of plates in which the top plate forces the lower one down. In many cases it's more like jiu-jitsu: the lower plate is actively sinking as the bend along its front edge works backward (slab rollback), so that the upper plate is actually sucked over the lower plate. This explains why there are often zones of stretching, or crustal extension, in the upper plate at subduction zones.</p>
</div>

<h2>Ocean Trenches and Accretionary Wedges</h2>

<p>Where the subducting slab bends downward, a deep-sea trench forms. The deepest of these is the Mariana Trench, at over 36,000 feet below sea level. Trenches capture a lot of sediment from nearby land masses, much of which is carried down along with the slab. In about half the world's trenches, some of that sediment is instead scraped off. It remains on top as a wedge of material, known as an accretionary wedge or prism, like snow in front of a plow. Slowly, the trench is pushed offshore as the upper plate grows. ​</p>

<h2>Volcanoes, Earthquakes and the Pacific Ring of Fire</h2>

<p>Once subduction begins, the materials on top of the slab—sediments, water, and delicate minerals—are carried down with it. The water, thick with dissolved minerals, rises into the upper plate.</p>

<p>There, this chemically active fluid enters an energetic cycle of volcanism and tectonic activity. This process forms arc volcanism and is sometimes known as the subduction factory. The rest of the slab keeps descending and leaves the realm of plate tectonics. </p>

<p>Subduction also forms some of Earth's most powerful earthquakes. Slabs normally subduct at a rate of a few centimeters per year, but sometimes the crust may stick and cause strain. This stores potential energy, which releases itself as an earthquake whenever the weakest point along the fault ruptures.</p>

<p>Subduction earthquakes can be very powerful, as the faults they occur along have a very large surface area to accumulate strain. The Cascadia Subduction Zone off the coast of northwest North America, for example, is over 600 miles long. A magnitude ~9 earthquake occurred along this zone in 1700 AD, and seismologists think the area may see another one soon.</p>

 

<p>Subduction-caused volcanism and earthquake activity occur frequently along the outer edges of the Pacific Ocean in an area known as the Pacific Ring of Fire. In fact, this area has seen the eight most powerful earthquakes ever recorded and is home to over 75 percent of the world's active and dormant volcanoes. </p>
