<h2>What tools do the professionals use?</h2>
    <ul>
       <li><b>A Computer :- </b> Maybe that sounds obvious to some people, but some of you are reading this article on your phone or a library computer. For serious web development, it's better to invest in a desktop or laptop computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux).</li>
       <li><b>A text editor :- </b> to write code in. This could be a text editor (e.g. Sublime, Brackets, Atom or Visual Studio Code), or a hybrid editor (e.g. Dreamweaver or WebStorm). Office document editors are not suitable for this use, as they rely on hidden elements that interfere with the rendering engines used by web browsers.</li>
	</ul>
<h2>What tools do I actually need, right now?</h2>
<p>You probably already have a basic text editor on your computer. By default Windows includes Notepad and macOS comes with TextEdit. Linux distros vary; Ubuntu comes with gedit by default.

For web development, you can probably do better than Notepad or TextEdit. We recommend starting out with Brackets, which is a free editor that offers live previews and code hints.</p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h2>What structure should your website have?</h2>
<h4>Next, let's look at what structure our test site should have. The most common things we'll have on any website project we create are an index HTML file and folders to contain images, style files, and script files. Let's create these now:</h4>
<ul>
	<li><b>index.html</b>: This file will generally contain your homepage content, that is, the text and images that people see when they first go to your site. Using your text editor, create a new file called index.html and save it just inside your test-site folder.</li>
	<li><b>images folder</b>: This folder will contain all the images that you use on your site. Create a folder called images, inside your test-site folder.</li>
	<li><b>styles folder</b>: This folder will contain the CSS code used to style your content (for example, setting text and background colors). Create a folder called styles, inside your test-site folder.</li>
    <li><b>scripts folder</b>: This folder will contain all the JavaScript code used to add interactive functionality to your site (e.g. buttons that load data when clicked). Create a folder called scripts, inside your test-site folder.</li>
</ul>

<h2>File Paths</h2>
<h4>To make files talk to one another, you have to provide a file path between them — basically a route so one file knows where another one is. To demonstrate this, we will insert a little bit of HTML into our index.html file, and make it display the image you chose in the article "What will your website look like?"</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Copy the image you chose earlier into your images folder.</li>
	<li>Open up your index.html file, and insert the following code into the file exactly as shown. Don't worry about what it all means for now — we'll look at the structures in more detail later in the series. </li>
	<li>The line <img src="" alt="My test image"> is the HTML code that inserts an image into the page. We need to tell the HTML where the image is. The image is inside the images directory, which is in the same directory as index.html. To walk down the file structure from index.html to our image, the file path we'd need is images/your-image-filename. For example, our image is called firefox-icon.png, so the file path is images/firefox-icon.png.</li>
	<li>Insert the file path into your HTML code between the double quote marks of the src="" code.</li>
	<li>Save your HTML file, then load it in your web browser (double-click the file). You should see your new webpage displaying your image! </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="jumbotron">
<h2>So what is HTML, really?</h2>
<p>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, and can make font bigger or smaller, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:</p>
    <div class="alert alert-warning">
    	<ol>
    	<li>My cat is very grumpy</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    The main parts of our element are:
<ol>
    <li><b>The opening tag</b>: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins, or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
    <li><b>The closing tag</b>: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the end of the paragraph is. Failing to include a closing tag is one of the common beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
    <li><b>The content</b>: This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.</li>
    <li><b>The element</b>: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
</ol>
Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute name, and editor-note is the attribute value. The < strong>class< /strong> attribute allows you to give the element an identifier that can be later used to target the element with style information and other things.

An attribute should always have:
<ol>
    <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
    The attribute name, followed by an equals sign.</li>
    <li>Opening and closing quote marks wrapped around the attribute value.</li>   
</ol>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<h2>Nesting elements</h2>
You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a < strong> element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:
<div class="well">
	<ol>
<li><p>My cat is < strong>very< /strong> grumpy.< /p  ></li>
    </ol> 
</div>
   You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested: in the example above we opened the < p > element first, then the < strong > element, therefore we have to close the < strong > element first, then <  p  >

</div>
<h2>Empty elements</h2>
Some elements have no content, and are called empty elements. Take the < img> element we already have in our HTML:
<div class="alert alert-info">
	<ol>
	<li>< img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"></li>
    </ol>
</div>
<div class="well">
This contains two attributes, but there is no closing < /img> tag, and no inner content. This is because an image element doesn't wrap content to have an effect on it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.
<h2>Anatomy of an HTML document</h2>
That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't very useful on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the code we put into our index.html example (which we first met in the Dealing with files article):

<div class="alert alert-warning">
	<ol>
		<li>< !DOCTYPE html></li>
<li>< html></li>
  <li>< head></li>
    <li>< meta charset="utf-8"></li>
    <li>< title>My test page</title></li>
  <li>< /head></li>
  <li>< body></li>
    <li>< img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"></li>
  <li>< /body></li>
<li>< /html></li>
	</ol>
</div>
Here we have:
<ol>
    <li><b>< !DOCTYPE html></b> — the doctype. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (about 1991/2), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However, these days no one really cares about them, and they are really just a historical artefact that needs to be included for everything to work right. For now, that's all you need to know.</li>
    <li><b>< html>< /html></b> — the < html> element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page, and is sometimes known as the root element.</li>
    <li><b>< head>< /head></b> — the < head> element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.</li>
    <li><b>< body>< /body></b> — the < body> element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</li>
    <li><b>< meta charset="utf-8"></b> — this element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. Essentially it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later on.</li>
    <li><b>< title>< /title></b> — the < title> element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favourite it.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Images</h2>

<h4>Let's turn our attention to the < img> element again:</h4>
<div class="alert alert-info">
< img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">
</div>
<p>As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the src (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.</p>

<p>We have also included an <strong>alt</strong> (alternative) attribute. In this attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because:</p>
<ol>
    <li>They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the alt text to them.</li>
    <li>Something has gone wrong causing the image to not display. For example, try deliberately changing the path inside your src attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the page, you should see something like this in place of the image:</li>
</ol>
The key words about alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current text of "My test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."

Try coming up with some better alt text for your image now.

<h2>Marking up text</h2>

<h4>This section will cover some of the basic HTML elements you'll use for marking up text.
Headings</h4>

Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings — of your content. In the same way that a book has a main title, chapter titles and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains six heading levels, < h1>–< h6> although you'll commonly only use 3–4 at most:
<div class="alert alert-info">
	<ol>
<li>< h1 >My main title< /h1></li>
<li>< h2 >My top level heading< /h2></li>
<li>< h3 >My subheading< /h3></li>
<li>< h4 >My sub-subheading< /h4></li>
    </ol>
</div>

Now try adding a suitable title to your HTML page just above your < img> element.
<h2>Paragraphs</h2>

As explained above, < p> elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content:
<div class="alert alert-info">
< p>This is a single paragraph</p>
</div>
Add your sample text (you should have it from What should your website look like?) into one or a few paragraphs, placed directly below your < img> element.
<h2>Lists</h2>

A lot of the web's content is lists, and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consist of at least two elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:
<ol>
   <li>Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, like a shopping list. These are wrapped in a < ul> element.</li>
   <li>Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, like a recipe. These are wrapped in an < ol> element.</li>
</ol>
Each item inside the lists is put inside an < li> (list item) element.

For example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following paragraph fragment into a list:
<div class="alert alert-info">
<ol>
	<li>< p>At Mozilla, we’re a global community of technologists, thinkers, and builders working together ... < /p></li>
</ol>
</div>

We could modify the markup to this:
<div class="alert alert-warning">

<ol>
<li>< p>At Mozilla, we’re a global community of< /p><li>
    
<li>< ul></li> 
  <li>< li>technologists< /li></li>
  <li>< li>thinkers< /li></li>
  <li>< li>builders< /li></li>
<li>< /ul></li>

<li>< p>working together ... < /p></li>
</ol>
</div>

Try adding an ordered or unordered list to your example page.
<h2>Links</h2>

<h4>Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple element — < a> — the "a" being short for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow these steps:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".</li>
    <li>Wrap the text in an < a> element, like so:</li>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    
    < a>Mozilla Manifesto< /a>
</div>
<li>Give the < a> element an href attribute, like so:</li>
<div class="alert alert-info">
< a href="">Mozilla Manifesto< /a>
</div>
Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to link to:
<div class="alert alert-info">
< a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto< /a>
</div>
</ul>

You might get unexpected results if you omit the https:// or http:// part, called the protocol, at the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you wanted it to.
<div class="alert alert-warning">
href might appear like a rather obscure choice for an attribute name at first. If you are having trouble remembering it, remember that it stands for hypertext reference.
</div>
Add a link to your page now, if you haven't already done so.

</div>
