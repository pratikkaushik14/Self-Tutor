<h2>Data Collection</h2>

<h4>This software manages sensing, measurements, light data filtering, light data security, and aggregation of data. It uses certain protocols to aid sensors in connecting with real-time, machine-to-machine networks. Then it collects data from multiple devices and distributes it in accordance with settings. It also works in reverse by distributing data over devices. The system eventually transmits all collected data to a central server.</h4>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h2>Device Integration</h2>
<h4>
Software supporting integration binds (dependent relationships) all system devices to create the body of the IoT system. It ensures the necessary cooperation and stable networking between devices. These applications are the defining software technology of the IoT network because without them, it is not an IoT system. They manage the various applications, protocols, and limitations of each device to allow communication.</h4>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<h2>Real-Time Analytics</h2>
<h4>
These applications take data or input from various devices and convert it into viable actions or clear patterns for human analysis. They analyze information based on various settings and designs in order to perform automation-related tasks or provide the data required by industry.
</h4>
</div>

             		<center><h1>Internet of Things - Common Uses</h1></center>
             	</div>
             	<h4>IoT has applications across all industries and markets. It spans user groups from those who want to reduce energy use in their home to large organizations who want to streamline their operations. It proves not just useful, but nearly critical in many industries as technology advances and we move towards the advanced automation imagined in the distant future.</h4>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<h1>Engineering, Industry, and Infrastructure</h1>

    <h4>Applications of IoT in these areas include improving production, marketing, service delivery, and safety. IoT provides a strong means of monitoring various processes; and real transparency creates greater visibility for improvement opportunities.</h4>

    <h4>The deep level of control afforded by IoT allows rapid and more action on those opportunities, which include events like obvious customer needs, nonconforming product, malfunctions in equipment, problems in the distribution network, and more.</h4>

<h2>Example</h2>

<h4>Joan runs a manufacturing facility that makes shields for manufacturing equipment. When regulations change for the composition and function of the shields, the new appropriate requirements are automatically programmed in production robotics, and engineers are alerted about their approval of the changes.</h4>

<h1>Government and Safety</h1>

    <h4>IoT applied to government and safety allows improved law enforcement, defense, city planning, and economic management. The technology fills in the current gaps, corrects many current flaws, and expands the reach of these efforts. For example, IoT can help city planners have a clearer view of the impact of their design, and governments have a better idea of the local economy.</h4>

<h2>Example</h2>

<h4>Joan lives in a small city. She’s heard about a recent spike in crime in her area, and worries about coming home late at night.</h4>

<h4>Local law enforcement has been alerted about the new “hot” zone through system flags, and they’ve increases their presence. Area monitoring devices have detected suspicious behavior, and law enforcement has investigated these leads to prevent crimes.</h4>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h1>
Home and Office
</h1>
<h4>
In our daily lives, IoT provides a personalized experience from the home to the office to the organizations we frequently do business with. This improves our overall satisfaction, enhances productivity, and improves our health and safety. For example, IoT can help us customize our office space to optimize our work.</h4>
<h2>
Example
</h2>
<h4>Joan works in advertising. She enters her office, and it recognizes her face. It adjusts the lighting and temperature to her preference. It turns on her devices and opens applications to her last working points.
</h4>
<h4>
Her office door detected and recognized a colleague visiting her office multiple times before she arrived. Joan’s system opens this visitor’s messages automatically.</h4>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<h1>
Health and Medicine
</h1>
<h4>
IoT pushes us towards our imagined future of medicine which exploits a highly integrated network of sophisticated medical devices. Today, IoT can dramatically enhance medical research, devices, care, and emergency care. The integration of all elements provides more accuracy, more attention to detail, faster reactions to events, and constant improvement while reducing the typical overhead of medical research and organizations.</h4>
<h2>
Example
</h2>
<h4>
Joan is a nurse in an emergency room. A call has come in for a man wounded in an altercation. The system recognized the patient and pulls his records. On the scene, paramedic equipment captures critical information automatically sent to the receiving parties at the hospital. The system analyzes the new data and current records to deliver a guiding solution. The status of the patient is updated every second in the system during his transport. The system prompts Joan to approve system actions for medicine distribution and medical equipment preparation.

             <div class="well">
             	<div class="jumbotron"><center><h2>Internet of Things - Environmental Monitoring</h2></center></div>

             	<h2>The applications of IoT in environmental monitoring are broad − environmental protection, extreme weather monitoring, water safety, endangered species protection, commercial farming, and more. In these applications, sensors detect and measure every type of environmental change.</h2>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h1>Air and Water Pollution</h1>

<h4>Current monitoring technology for air and water safety primarily uses manual labor along with advanced instruments, and lab processing. IoT improves on this technology by reducing the need for human labor, allowing frequent sampling, increasing the range of sampling and monitoring, allowing sophisticated testing on-site, and binding response efforts to detection systems. This allows us to prevent substantial contamination and related disasters.</h4>
<h1>Extreme Weather</h1>

<h4>Though powerful, advanced systems currently in use allow deep monitoring, they suffer from using broad instruments, such as radar and satellites, rather than more granular solutions. Their instruments for smaller details lack the same accurate targeting of stronger technology.</h4>

<h4>New IoT advances promise more fine-grained data, better accuracy, and flexibility. Effective forecasting requires high detail and flexibility in range, instrument type, and deployment. This allows early detection and early responses to prevent loss of life and property.</h4>

<h1>
Commercial Farming
</h1>
<h4>Today's sophisticated commercial farms have exploited advanced technology and biotechnology for quite some time, however, IoT introduces more access to deeper automation and analysis.
</h4>
<div class="well">
<center><img src="images/IOT4.jpg" style="height:350px;width:500px"></img></center>
</div>
<h4>Much of commercial farming, like weather monitoring, suffers from a lack of precision and requires human labor in the area of monitoring. Its automation also remains limited.</h4>

<h4>IoT allows operations to remove much of the human intervention in system function, farming analysis, and monitoring. Systems detect changes to crops, soil, environment, and more. They optimize standard processes through analysis of large, rich data collections. They also prevent health hazards (e.g., e. coli) from happening and allow better control.</h4>

        </div>    

        <div class="well">
        	<div class="jumbotron"><center><h2>Internet of Things - Energy Application</h2s></center></div>
        	<h4>The optimization qualities of IoT in manufacturing also apply to energy consumption. IoT allows a wide variety of energy control and monitoring functions, with applications in devices, commercial and residential energy use, and the energy source. Optimization results from the detailed analysis previously unavailable to most organizations and individuals.</h4>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h2>Residential Energy</h2>
<h4>
The rise of technology has driven energy costs up. Consumers search for ways to reduce or control consumption. IoT offers a sophisticated way to analyze and optimize use not only at device level, but throughout the entire system of the home. This can mean simple switching off or dimming of lights, or changing device settings and modifying multiple home settings to optimize energy use.
</h4>
<h4>
IoT can also discover problematic consumption from issues like older appliances, damaged appliances, or faulty system components. Traditionally, finding such problems required the use of often multiple professionals.
</h4>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<h2>Commercial Energy</h2>
<h4>
Energy waste can easily and quietly impact business in a major way, given the tremendous energy needs of even small organizations. Smaller organizations wrestle with balancing costs of business while delivering a product with typically smaller margins, and working with limited funding and technology. Larger organizations must monitor a massive, complex ecosystem of energy use that offers few simple, effective solutions for energy use management.
</h4>
<h4>IoT simplifies the process of energy monitoring and management while maintaining a low cost and high level of precision. It addresses all points of an organization's consumption across devices. Its depth of analysis and control provides organizations with a strong means of managing their consumption for cost shaving and output optimization. IoT systems discover energy issues in the same way as functional issues in a complex business network, and provide solutions.
</h4>
<h2>
Reliability
</h2>
<h4>
The analytics and action delivered by IoT also help to ensure system reliability. Beyond consumption, IoT prevents system overloads or throttling. It also detects threats to system performance and stability, which protects against losses such as downtime, damaged equipment, and injuries.
</h4>
</div>
        </div>
        <div class="well">
        	<div class="jumbotron"><center><h1>Internet of Things - Education</h1></center></div>
        	<h4>IoT in the classroom combines the benefits of IoT in content delivery, business, and healthcare. It customizes and enhances education by allowing optimization of all content and forms of delivery. It enables educators to give focus to individuals and their method. It also reduces costs and labor of education through automation of common tasks outside of the actual education process.</h4>
        	
        	<div class="alert alert-success"><h2>
Education Organizations
</h2>
<h4>
Education organizations typically suffer from limited funding, labor issues, and poor attention to actual education. They, unlike other organizations, commonly lack or avoid analytics due to their funding issues and the belief that analytics do not apply to their industry.
</h4>
<h4>
IoT not only provides valuable insight, but it also democratizes that information through lowcost, low-power small devices, which still offer high performance. This technology aids in managing costs, improving the quality of education, professional development, and facility management improvement through rich examinations of key areas −
</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Student response, performance, and behavior</li>
    <li>Instructor response, performance, and behavior</li>
    <li>Facility monitoring and maintenance</li>
    <li>Data from other facilities</li>
</ol>

<h4>Data informs them about ineffective strategies and actions, whether educational efforts or facility qualities. Removing these roadblocks makes them more effective.</h4>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h2>
Educators
</h2>
<h4>
Information provided by IoT empowers educators to deliver improved education. They have a window into the success of their strategies, their students' perspective, and other aspects of their performance. IoT relieves them of administrative and management duties, so they can focus on their mission. It automates manual and clerical labor, and facilitates supervising through features like system flags or controls to ensure students remain engaged.
</h4>
<div class="well">
<center><img src="images/IOT4.jpg" style="height:350px;width:500px"></img></center>
</div>
<h4>IoT provides instructors with easy access to powerful educational tools. Educators can use IoT to perform as a one-on-one instructor providing specific instructional designs for each pupil; for example, using data to determine the most effective supplements for each student, and autogenerating content from lesson materials on-demand for any student.</h4>

<h4>The application of technology improves the professional development of educators because they truly see what works, and learn to devise better strategies, rather than simply repeating old or ineffective methods.</h4>

<h4>IoT also enhances the knowledge base used to devise education standards and practices. Education research suffers from accuracy issues and a general lack of data. IoT introduces large high quality, real-world datasets into the foundation of educational design. This comes from IoT's unique ability to collect enormous amounts of varied data anywhere.</h4>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<h2>Personalized Education</h2>

<h4>IoT facilitates the customization of education to give every student access to what they need. Each student can control their experience and participate in instructional design, and much of this happens passively. The student simply utilizes the system, and performance data primarily shapes their design. This combined with organizational and educator optimization delivers highly effective education while reducing costs.
